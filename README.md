# University Admissions Prediction

### **Description**: 
This project is about predicting the chances of admission of an idividual in a university.
In this project, we trained different models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile. This project could be practically used to get the university acceptance rate for individual students using web application.

             
### **Aim**:       
The ease of making better choices and decisions in terms of admission. This analysis of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile,makes it easier for them to make accurate decision about their preferred colleges. Our analysis with different models would help giving probable accuracy and this requires analytical methods for predicting future recommendation.
Today, most students make mistakes in their preference list due to lack of knowledge, improper and incorrect analysis of colleges and insecure predictions. 
Hence, repent and regret later. Our project will solve the general issue of the student community by using technology.

### **WorkFlow**:  

We will go through the following tasks:
1. Understand the Problem Statement
2. Import libraries and datasets
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Perform Data Visualization
5. Create Training and Testing Datasets
6. Train and Evaluate a Linear Regression Model
7. Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model
8. Train and Evaluate a Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Model
9. Understand the various regression KPIs
10. Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs
             
### **Objectives**: 
1. Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset.
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
1. Understand the distribution and relationship of data
1. Split and Standardize training and testing dataset
1. Train various regression models using Scikit-Learn
1. Train Artificial Neural Network models to perform regression tasks
1. Evaluate, compare and analyze the performance of different regression models
1. Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, adjusted R2

             
### **Models Used**: 
Various regression models used are:
1. Linear Regression Model
2. Artificial Neural Network
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
              
### **Results**:   
    Accuracy of models:
    1.Linear Regression Model:   0.7874878546005898
    2.Artificial Neural Network: 0.6983130276203156
    3.Decision Tree:             0.5070773307560377
    4.Random Forest:             0.7610585003959265
               
### **Advantages**: 
- It helps student for making decision for choosing a right college.
- Here the chance of occurrence of error is less when compared with the existing system.
- It is fast, efficient and reliable.

### **Conclusion**: 
For the given data, the accuracy of the linear regression model was the best.
